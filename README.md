Data Scientist Nanodegree Program

This repository contains a project completed as part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The goal of the project is to perform data analysis using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Repository contents:

analysis.ipynb â€“ Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and conclusions
PurchaseOrders.csv â€“ dataset used for analysis (please download from this repository and modify the code in line 87 according to your file location)
README.md â€“ project description

Dataset description:
The file PurchaseOrders.csv contains purchase order data.
The data was created or adapted for educational purposes only.

Technologies:
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

Project objectives:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning and preparation
Building a basic predictive model
Visualizing results

How to run the project:
Clone the repository from GitHub
Make sure the file PurchaseOrders.csv is downloaded from this repository
Open the file analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
Run the notebook cell by cell
Note: The notebook code is set to load data from PurchaseOrders.csv. If needed, adjust the file path accordingly.

The result of the analysis of delayed deliveries is a review of the purchasing process, with an initial â€“ and interestingly, unexpected â€“ focus on the requester m89398 and the material group C530500. Contrary to common assumptions, the supplier is not always the one at fault ðŸ˜‰
